## Prerequisites

To make contributions to this project, the following system dependencies must be available on the machine used for contributions:

- [Node Version Manager](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

## Downloading

Before making any changes, the codebase must be downloaded locally. Follow the steps below to download this project:

```bash
# Navigate the shell to the preferred destination folder for the download.
git clone https://github.com/outshift-open/open-ui-kit.git

# Use your local navigation command (`cd` on Unix-based operating systems) to navigate to the newly downloaded folder.
cd open-ui-kit
```

## Environment

After downloading the project, initialization of the environment is needed. Use the `nvm` command to install the correct version of `node` and `npm` for this project using the following command example:

```bash
nvm install
```

This should install the current version of node (if not already installed) to the designated version stored within `./.nvmrc` and set it within the current terminal environment.

## Installation

After setting up the environment, the following command can be used to install all dependencies for this project:

```bash
yarn install
```

After installation, be sure to validate that a `./node_modules` folder was created, and that there are no errors in the terminal.

_**Note**: In some cases, the connection while downloading can halt due to a networking error. Be sure to fully clean the `./node_modules` folder under these conditions and try again._

## Storybook

[Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) is used as the documentation tool for this project. To build and view our documentation tool (in watch mode), please follow the steps below:

- `yarn run build`
- `yarn run storybook`

- **Main package location**: `packages/open-ui-kit/` contains the core component library
- **Package name**: The published package is `@open-ui-kit/core` on npm
- **Development**: Most development work happens in the `packages/open-ui-kit/` directory
- **Testing locally**: Use `yarn link` to test your changes in other projects

### Building the Package

```bash
# Build all packages
yarn build

# Build and test the core package specifically
cd packages/open-ui-kit
yarn build
yarn test
```
